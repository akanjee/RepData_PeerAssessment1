# Reproduceable Research - Course Assignment # 1


##Loading and preprocessing the data
1. First we will set the working directory and load the packages
```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/R Working Directory/Course_5_Reproducable_Research/")
```

2. Next we will load the data and store it into a variable we will call ActivityDataSet; per the assignments instructions we will not exclude the NA items at this time
```{r}
ActivityDataSet <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(ActivityDataSet)
```
###DAILY ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

#### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
4. We will now find the mean number of steps in the data set - please note I have ignored the NA items
```{r}
MeanNumberOfSteps <-mean(ActivityDataSet$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
MeanNumberOfSteps
```

#### Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
5. We will aggregate the information to a daily basis and find the total, the mean and median
```{r}
TotalStepsPerDay <-with(ActivityDataSet,tapply(steps,date,sum,na.rm=TRUE))
hist(TotalStepsPerDay)
summary(TotalStepsPerDay)
```
#### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(TotalStepsPerDay, xlab = "Number of Steps", ylab="Frequency", main = "Histogram of Total Steps Per Day")
```

#### Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r} 
DailyMean <-mean(TotalStepsPerDay)
DailyMedian <-median(TotalStepsPerDay)
summary(TotalStepsPerDay)
```

#### What is the average daily activity pattern?
The Average daily activity pattern is approximately `r as.integer(DailyMean)` Steps per day

#### Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

6. First we will calculate the average number of steps across all of the days for the specified time periods
```{r}

AverageStepsPer5minPeriod <-with(ActivityDataSet,tapply(steps,interval,mean,na.rm=TRUE))

```

7. Next we will plot the average steps for each interval across all of the days 
```{r}
barplot(AverageStepsPer5minPeriod, 
        xlab = "Interval", 
        ylab="Average Number of Steps", 
        main = "Average Number of Steps Per Interval for the 30 day span"
        )
```

#### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

The 5-minute interval with the max average number of daily steps is NEED TO CALCULATE with approximately `r as.integer(max(AverageStepsPer5minPeriod))` steps

##Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

###Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r}
EmptyRows <-subset(ActivityDataSet,is.na(ActivityDataSet$steps))
nrow(EmptyRows)
```

Therefore there are 'r nrow(EmptyRows)' in the data set.

###Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.   The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

8. This is an interesting challenge.  I will use the mean for the interval (ignoring NAs) as I believe that it will be better fit than the daily mean  

I will first calculate the mean for each day using the TAPPLY function
```{r}
IntervalMean <-aggregate(ActivityDataSet$steps,list(ActivityDataSet$interval),mean, na.rm=TRUE)
head(IntervalMean)
```

After we've calculated the Interval mean, we will create a data set that replaces the NA's with the interval mean
```{r}
DF2 <- ActivityDataSet
head(DF2) 
NAs.a <-is.na(DF2$steps)
head(NAs.a)
DF2$steps[NAs.a] <-IntervalMean[match(DF2$interval[NAs.a], IntervalMean$Group.1), ]$x
head(DF2)
```

##Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and 
```{r}
TotalStepsPerDay2 <-with(DF2,tapply(steps,date,sum))
hist(TotalStepsPerDay2, xlab="Daily Steps", ylab="Number of Days", main = "Daily Step Count Histogram with Imputed Values for NA Entries")
```

##Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

```{r}
summary(TotalStepsPerDay2)
```

##Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
Yes the values differ from the first part of the assignment.  

##What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Imputing the missing data by subsitituiting the mean for the given time period changes the way that the days are distributed.  In part 1 there was ~25 days where people took between 10,000 and 15,000 steps.  Also we see more days with over 15,000 steps in Part 2 and fewer days with less than 10,000 steps

```{r}
par(mfcol=c(1,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2))

hist(TotalStepsPerDay, xlab="Daily Steps", ylab="Number of Days", main = "Daily Step Count Histogram with NA Entries Omitted")
hist(TotalStepsPerDay2, xlab="Daily Steps", ylab="Number of Days", main = "Daily Step Count Histogram with Imputed Values for NA Entries")
```

### Weekday vs. Weekend Analysis

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

##Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
DF2$DayOfWeek <- weekdays(as.Date(DF2$date))

for (i in 1:nrow(DF2))
    {
        DF2$WDorWE[i] <- 
            if (DF2$DayOfWeek[i] == "Saturday") {"Weekend"
        } else if(DF2$DayOfWeek[i] == "Sunday") {"Weekend"
        } else{"Weekday"}
    }
```

##Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r}
par(mfcol=c(1,2), mar=c(2,2,2,2))
DF3  <-subset(DF2,DF2$WDorWE=="Weekday")
DF4  <-subset(DF2,DF2$WDorWE=="Weekend")
AverageStepsPerWeekday <-aggregate(DF3$steps,list(DF3$interval),mean)
AverageStepsPerWeekend <-aggregate(DF4$steps,list(DF4$interval),mean)

plot(AverageStepsPerWeekday$Group.1, AverageStepsPerWeekday$x, type="l", xlab="Time of Day", ylab="Average Steps Per Day", main="Average Steps per Week Day")
plot(AverageStepsPerWeekend$Group.1, AverageStepsPerWeekend$x, type="l", xlab="Time of Day", ylab="Average Steps Per Day", main="Average Steps per Week End")

```

Based on the plots we can see that during the week step activity peaks around 12:00 and 18:00, on the weekends the step activity is spread out across theday
